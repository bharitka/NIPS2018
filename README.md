# NIPS2018
The ipslateral and contralateral responses are generated from different files (IPSI_STACKEDAUTOENC_NIPS2018.m, and CONTRA_STACKEDAUTOENC_NIPS2018.m). Each of the files require an input horizontal angle in degrees relative to mdian plane (000)--to the left (090) to behind (180). The impulse responses and magnitude responses are plotted as well
